# JHU 2016 laboratory

## Gaussian
* Create a specific module for plotting and models' functions DONE
* In models.py : change the precision to variance DONE
* Create a new notebook based on the new modules DONE
* Create an interactive plot to play with the mean and the variance of the Gaussian DONE
* Create an interactive plot for the Gaussian with precision instead of mean

## GMM
* Create an interactive plot for the GMM
* Animated EM algorithm -> Exercise: Choose different initialisation for the EM.

## Gibbs Sampling 
* Implement GS
* Plot averaging


## Laboratory
* Data sampled from some density 
* We'd like to model our training data

### Simple gaussian modeling
* Introduction Gaussian 
* Normal Gamma Prior
